# Formal Evaluation Set

Use this file only when testing or revising the skill. Do not load it during ordinary prompt generation.

## Scoring Rubric

Score each case out of 100:

- Story diagnosis and structure choice: 15
- Duration and pacing feasibility: 15
- Camera, axis, eyeline, and spatial continuity: 15
- Character performance and emotional clarity: 15
- Dialogue timing and sound design: 10
- Reference-image consistency: 10
- Prompt clarity, compression, and length compliance: 10
- Scene-specific negative constraints and safety: 10

Pass levels:

- 90-100: production-ready
- 80-89: usable with minor revision
- 70-79: major weakness in one area
- below 70: revise rules or output strategy

Automatic failure conditions:

- final prompt exceeds the duration-based character ceiling without recommending a split
- single segment exceeds 30 seconds
- key plot-changing dialogue is omitted
- dialogue cannot physically fit its assigned time
- continuation resets character, scene, prop, or emotional state
- action direction becomes contradictory or axis flips without motivation
- unsafe explicit sexual content, sexualized minors, or gore-focused violence

## Evaluation Procedure

For each case:

1. Generate the answer in workshop mode.
2. Measure only the copy-ready final prompt against the duration-based character ceiling.
3. Check timing beat by beat.
4. Mark continuity states: position, direction, held object, costume, light, emotional residue.
5. Record failures and update rules only when the failure is generalizable.

- crying starts instantly

## Case 04: Suspense Spatial Continuity

Input:

```text
独居女孩回家发现玄关多了一把陌生钥匙，走进客厅后听见卧室里传来手机震动。15秒，不出现鬼怪或袭击者。
```

Expected:

- Scene reference defines玄关、客厅、卧室门的 spatial relationship.
- Character movement direction remains continuous.
- Suspense comes from sound and withheld information.
- No jump scare, monster, or unexplained location flip.

Failure checks:

- bedroom switches screen side
- protagonist teleports between spaces

## Case 05: Match-on-Action Emotional Prop

Input:

```text
分手后的两个人在清晨厨房同时伸手拿同一只杯子，手指碰到后都假装没事。10秒。
```

Expected:

- Use match-on-action: medium start of reach -> close continuation at cup.
- Change shot size and horizontal camera angle.
- Cup position and which hands touch remain consistent.
- One short exchange only; leave ending breath.

Failure checks:

- reach action restarts in the second shot
- cup jumps location or hand side

## Case 06: 1v1 Fight Choreography

Input:

```text
废旧仓库地下擂台，两名成年女性进行10秒真人格斗。第一轮拳腿试探，第二轮近身反摔。多人围观但不参与。
```

Expected:

- Structure: fight choreography.
- 2 shots, 6-8 total action beats.
- Attack line, evasion, contact point, footwork, weight transfer, camera response.
- Stable A/B screen positions until a visible pivot or throw.
- Use 2-4 principal camera methods selected for specific fight beats; no unmotivated stacking of orbit, whip pan, push-in, slow motion, and impact hold.
- Final prompt 1300-1800 characters when the selected duration is 10-15s; longer 16-30s fight prompts may use up to 2800 characters if every beat is necessary.
- Staged, non-lethal, no gore.

Failure checks:

- more than 10 action beats
- crowd enters fight
- throw occurs without level change/grip/momentum setup
- camera tricks obscure contact points, landing positions, or the attack-defense chain

## Case 07: Environmental Fight

Input:

```text
古代赌坊翻脸，江湖赌客利用赌桌、骰盅、长凳和木柱反制两名打手。15秒，无血腥。
```

Expected:

- Clear room layout and environmental anchors.
- Cause-effect chain: body -> prop contact -> prop reaction -> opponent reaction -> camera reaction.
- 2-3 shots, no more than 10 beats.
- Props do not teleport or randomly break.
- Final prompt under the duration-based character ceiling.

Failure checks:

- too many simultaneous attackers/actions
- furniture positions change between shots
- impact lacks environmental consequence

## Case 08: Large-Scene Compression

Input:

```text
暴风雨夜客轮倾斜，乘客逃生，母亲逆流寻找孩子，最后隔着正在关闭的防水舱门看见他。15秒。
```

Expected:

- One visual anchor: mother's distinctive clothing.
- Crowd acts as pressure, not competing protagonists.
- 4-5 clear story nodes maximum.
- Spatial direction toward the watertight door remains consistent.
- Child's line, if used, finishes before final held reaction.

Failure checks:

- protagonist lost in crowd
- disaster spectacle overwhelms story
- final line lands at 15.0s with no breath

## Case 09: Long Story Split and Tail Frame

Input:

```text
30秒剧情：多年未归的男人在深夜老火车站与年迈母亲重逢。拆成两个15秒，并用第一段尾帧生成第二段。
```

Expected:

- Segment 1: discovery and approach; stable tail-frame composition.
- Segment 2: begins from exact previous state; recognition and touch.
- Same clothing, light, bench, sweater, positions, and sound bed.
- Each final prompt under the duration-based character ceiling.

Failure checks:

- second segment restarts with a new establishing shot
- mother already recognizes him in segment 1
- prop or lighting changes

## Case 10: Continuation with New Character and Location

Input:

```text
上一段：女孩在公寓接到男友去世的电话，结尾蜷缩在地板上。继续下一段：她赶到医院，第一次见到男友的姐姐。
```

Expected:

- Continuation diagnosis explains emotional and spatial transition.
- Reuse protagonist reference; add new sister character reference and hospital scene reference.
- Preserve protagonist clothing, phone, tear state, and emotional residue unless a time gap is stated.
- Do not replay the phone reveal.

Failure checks:

- no new visual references
- protagonist appears freshly composed without transition
- too many hospital events in one segment

## Case 11: Vague Input Handling

Input:

```text
我要一个很震撼、很电影感的视频。
```

Expected:

- Ask one concise question covering missing foundation: protagonist, setting, and intended emotion/transformation.
- Do not invent a full story immediately.

Failure checks:

- generic spectacle prompt
- asks for lenses, lighting, or other technical details before story foundations

## Case 12: Reference Consistency

Input:

```text
古代闺中小姐在午后窗边突然看见心上人，10秒超近面部特写，无台词。先给人物参考图，再给视频提示词。
```

Expected:

- Character prompt and video prompt match age, hairstyle, hairpins, clothing, light, makeup, and emotional baseline.
- Camera may represent the beloved's POV.
- No second person visible.
- No contradictory lighting or fashion-poster pose.

Failure checks:

- character details drift between reference and video prompt
- overt seduction replaces restrained shy love
- camera movement conflicts with fixed-close-up request

## Case 13: Automatic Compression

Input:

```text
请把一个包含3名角色、4个镜头、两段台词、雨夜车内争吵和一次下车动作的15秒提示词压缩到2000字以内，但保留剧情和情绪。
```

Expected:

- Apply the compression ladder before splitting.
- Remove repeated style/light/sound descriptions first.
- Preserve plot-changing dialogue, spatial continuity, reaction, and ending breath.
- If still overloaded, reduce shot/event count or recommend splitting.

Failure checks:

- removes the core reveal or listener reaction
- compresses into unreadable fragments
- leaves repeated style boilerplate while cutting causality

## Case 14: Character Bible Continuity

Input:

```text
连续三段古风短片使用同一位26岁宫廷女子：第一段发簪完整，第二段逃跑时左侧发簪掉落，第三段躲进偏殿继续剧情。
```

Expected:

- Canonical identity remains stable.
- Temporary state updates after segment 2: left hairpin missing, hair slightly loose, clothing wet/dusty if established.
- Segment 3 does not restore the missing hairpin.
- Reference assets mark `更新状态`, not a new identity.

Failure checks:

- face, age, costume, or hair color drifts
- missing accessory resets
- state change occurs without visible action

## Case 15: Scene Bible and Prop State

Input:

```text
在同一间深夜公寓连续生成两段：第一段女孩把手机放在客厅地板右侧并走向卧室；第二段她听见敲门后返回客厅。
```

Expected:

- Apartment layout, bedroom side, door, light direction, and travel direction remain stable.
- Phone remains on the floor until picked up on screen.
- The second segment begins from the previous tail-frame state.

Failure checks:

- phone appears in hand without pickup
- bedroom/door swaps side
- lighting or time resets

## Case 16: Output Mode Selection

Inputs:

```text
A：直接给我最终提示词，不要分析。
B：先诊断剧情，我想一起调整。
C：这是一个连续5段短片，请维护人物和场景一致性。
```

Expected:

- A uses compact mode.
- B uses workshop mode.
- C uses continuous-short-film mode with character/scene continuity and tail-frame anchors.

Failure checks:

- outputs the same structure for all three
- compact mode includes unnecessary references
- continuous mode omits reusable continuity records

## Case 17: Coquettish Soft Refusal Close-Up

Input:

```text
年轻女子在亲密但安全的关系里小声说“我不要”，她不是真的拒绝，而是带点娇嗔、害羞和被宠爱的任性。6秒固定面部特写，不要露骨，不要夸张撒娇。
```

Expected:

- Structure: ultra-close face long take / coquettish soft refusal arc.
- The line `我不要` is explicitly written and timed.
- Performance reads as gentle, safe, playful softness: gaze dodges then returns, mouth suppresses a smile, body does not retreat.
- No real fear, coercion, disgust, explicit seduction, childish baby voice, or cartoonish pout.
- Final prompt target: 500-800 characters.

Failure checks:

- interprets the refusal as fear or non-consent
- turns the scene into overt sexualization or exposed-body emphasis
- uses exaggerated idol-drama acting instead of subtle micro-expression
- omits the spoken line

## Case 18: General Camera Movement Function

Input:

```text
15秒心理悬疑：男人在空荡地铁站发现站台对面的人和自己长得一模一样。先是普通等待，然后听见广播故障声，抬头看见对面，世界感突然失衡，最后他没有逃，只是僵住。
```

Expected:

- Camera movement is selected by function, not stacked as decoration.
- Ordinary waiting can use `Static` or subtle `Handheld`; discovery can use `Pan` or `Push-In`; psychological vertigo may use one brief `Dolly Zoom` or `Dutch Angle Static`.
- No more than 2-3 principal moves in the final prompt.
- Movement has readable start/end subjects and leaves 1-2s frozen aftermath.
- Station geography and screen direction remain clear.

Failure checks:

- piles up `Push-In`, `Orbit`, `Zoom`, `Whip Pan`, `Handheld`, and `Dutch Angle` in the same beat
- uses `Dolly Zoom` without a major realization
- camera movement obscures the double's position or the protagonist's reaction
- ending cuts immediately at the discovery without aftermath

## Case 19: Live Performance Realism

Input:

```text
晚上家里餐桌前，年轻女性对镜头解释为什么她没有去参加朋友婚礼。她表面平静，其实很在意这件事。10秒，手机实拍感，半身近景，一杯水放在桌上。
```

Expected:

- Strategy mentions live performance realism or psychological motive.
- Performance is driven by one motive: restrained explanation of something that matters to her.
- Eye line, pauses, voice pace, mouth corners, breath, and small gestures align with that motive.
- Body language is low-amplitude and incidental: slight head dip, small nod, fingers near cup, sleeve adjustment, tiny weight shift.
- Biomechanics are linked: eyes move before head, neck/shoulders follow, breath affects chest/voice, hand movement involves wrist/forearm/sleeve.
- Object contact has weight and sequence: fingertips approach cup, contact, slight pressure/friction, cup remains stable.
- Environment responds subtly: hair, sleeve folds, cup reflection, warm light/shadow, room tone.
- Camera/light/focus stay consistent with phone indoor realism; no commercial studio look.

Failure checks:

- fixed fake smile or empty eyes
- gestures added only to make the frame busy
- isolated head/hand movement with frozen shoulders and no breath
- hand/cup penetration, cup drift, or object movement before contact
- character feels pasted onto the background
- phone realism mixed with perfect studio lighting, plastic skin, or ad-like stabilization

## Case 20: Ordinary Drama One-Take Blocking

Input:

```text
15秒一镜到底：深夜厨房里，妻子发现丈夫藏在水槽下的诊断报告。丈夫从客厅走进来想解释，她没有立刻质问，只是把报告慢慢推回原处，最后两人隔着厨房岛台沉默对视。
```

Expected:

- Structure: single take, ordinary drama one-take blocking.
- Clear start frame and spatial anchors: kitchen island, sink cabinet, living-room entrance, report.
- One physically possible camera path, not multiple invisible cuts.
- Blocking changes relationship pressure: wife near sink/island, husband entering from living-room side, island between them at the end.
- Use `Rack Focus` or `Focus Pull` only if it clarifies report -> wife reaction -> husband entrance.
- Keep screen direction, prop position, lighting, and body distance continuous.
- End with 1-2s held silence after the report is pushed back.

Failure checks:

- says one-take but describes unrelated camera angles or cuts
- report jumps from hand to drawer/counter without visible action
- husband teleports into the kitchen or changes side of the island
- uses too many camera moves instead of one coherent path
- ends on the line/reveal without silence or reaction

## Case 21: One-Take Character Reveal Ladder

Input:

```text
15秒一镜到底古装府邸庭院群像：嫡长子、嫡长女、庶子、庶女四人暗中对峙。要求从嫡长子面部特写开始，通过环绕、背影遮挡、横移、后拉逐步揭示其他人，最后形成庭院权力站位。无台词。
```

Expected:

- Structure: single take with character reveal ladder.
- Starts on one face only, then reveals others progressively rather than showing all four at once.
- Uses foreground/back/shoulder/table/column masking to keep the one-take path physical.
- Each character has distinct identity anchors: face impression, hair/headdress, costume color/material, posture, status, emotional baseline.
- Pull-back or widening clarifies hierarchy and courtyard layout.
- Stable lighting/atmosphere is summarized once; night courtyard light stays physically plausible: moonlight as soft ambient/edge light, face readability from lantern/candle/corridor/window spill or stone/table bounce, no hard moonlight cutting a face without source logic.
- No duplicate faces, extra people, modern objects, or identity drift.

Failure checks:

- describes cuts while claiming one-take
- reveals four people too fast with no spatial logic
- characters have similar faces/clothes or duplicated identity
- camera path circles/passes through impossible space
- lighting and style tags crowd out blocking, identity, and hierarchy
- cold moonlight or abstract cinematic lighting creates an unrealistic hard face spotlight in an outdoor courtyard

## Case 22: Prompt Sampling Range Control

Input:

```text
做一个10秒破碎记忆闪回：女孩站在雨夜车站，脑中闪回车祸、红伞、碎玻璃、短信。要电影感，情绪是突然想起真相。
```

Expected:

- Strategy names the abstract effect and translates `破碎记忆闪回` into visible fragments rather than leaving it as a style label.
- Final prompt uses a small number of concrete memory shards, such as rain on glass, red umbrella reflected in a puddle, headlight flare, phone vibration, glass shards catching light, and the girl's eyes refocusing.
- The memory fragments are physically compatible; no object is asked to break into fragments and form an impossible unrelated shape at the same time.
- The desired action path is written positively: the girl freezes, visual shards intrude, her gaze locks onto one clue, and she realizes the truth.
- Negative constraints are short and secondary, focused on likely failures such as no subtitles/watermarks, no background music, no face distortion, and no over-glowy fantasy.
- Details are limited to the strongest 4-5 visual anchors so the 10s clip remains playable and not over-specified.

Failure checks:

- only says `破碎记忆闪回` or `电影感特效` without visible screen evidence
- relies on `不要混乱、不要发呆、不要失败` instead of describing the desired visual/action path
- contains contradictory object behavior, impossible lighting, or incompatible camera movement
- lists too many fragments, props, overlays, camera moves, and emotions for 10 seconds
- negative constraints become longer than the positive creative prompt

## Case 23: Execution Stability and Prop Endpoint

Input:

```text
12秒悬疑戏：深夜办公室，女律师发现桌上的U盘里有关键证据，她刚插进电脑，门外响起脚步声，她立刻拔下U盘藏进左手袖口，假装继续看文件。
```

Expected:

- Final prompt opening is reconstructable: office layout, woman position, desk/computer/U-disk start state, shot size, angle, gaze, and practical light source are clear.
- Each shot has one core action and one core camera behavior; camera movement does not compete with the U-disk handling.
- U-disk state is precise: where it starts, which hand inserts it, when it is pulled out, how it is hidden in the left sleeve, and where it ends.
- Ending state is locked because this can continue: woman seated or standing, left sleeve hiding the U-disk, file in front of her, gaze/face pretending calm, door/footstep direction established.
- No unresolved options such as `或`, `或者`, `A/B`, `可选`.
- Sound includes diegetic anchors: computer USB sound, distant footsteps, paper movement, breath or room tone; no background music by default.

Failure checks:

- starts with a vague office mood and does not specify the first frame
- says `她藏好U盘` without holder/hand/contact/final location
- uses several competing camera moves in one shot
- ends before showing the hidden U-disk state and her cover behavior
- includes optional branches like `藏进袖口或抽屉`
- relies mainly on negative constraints instead of positive stable action

## Case 24: Dialogue-Driven Performance Control

Input:

```text
15秒情感控诉戏：深夜客厅，女人终于知道丈夫三年前就隐瞒了她父亲病危的消息。她一开始不是哭，而是冷静反击，说：“你一直都知道，对吗？那我这三年算什么？”第一句带攻击，第二句说到“我”时声音变轻，最后才掉下第一滴眼泪。丈夫坐在对面沉默。
```

Expected:

- Strategy mentions dialogue-driven performance control, trigger words, or emotion barrier.
- The prompt does not write `女人悲伤地哭着说` as a single mood label. It treats the dialogue as the expression timeline.
- The first line is still protected by anger or cold control; grief does not appear fully at the start.
- The trigger word is clear, especially `我` or `三年`; the second line changes voice, gaze, face, and body after that word.
- Pauses, breath, short inhale, swallowing, gaze drop, mouth tightening, or jaw release are tied to the line delivery.
- First tear is delayed until after the protection layer cracks; it does not fall before or during the first attack line.
- Optional AU/FACS, if used, appears after natural-language facial actions and stays compact, such as AU1/AU15/AU17 from B to C.
- Husband's listener reaction is included but restrained; he should not steal the scene.
- Ending leaves 1-2s for silence, breath, tear fall, or room tone after the line.

Failure checks:

- emotion jumps directly from anger to crying with no protective layer
- dialogue is pasted under a generic sadness/anger label
- no trigger word, no pause, no breath, no post-line state
- first tear appears too early
- AU codes are dumped without visible natural-language facial action
- listener overacts or interrupts the main performance
- ending cuts immediately after the last word

## Case 25: 30s Duration Selection and Long Prompt Budget

Input:

```text
30秒现实情感对话戏：清晨出租屋，准备搬走的女人把钥匙放在桌上，男人假装平静地说“你走吧，我没事”。女人停住，没有回头，问：“你真的没事，还是只是不想留我？”男人先笑了一下，想把话题带过去，随后终于承认：“我怕我一开口，就会显得太难看。”最后两人没有拥抱，只隔着一张旧餐桌沉默。要求表演自然，有停顿和呼吸，不要大哭。
```

Expected:

- Diagnosis explains why this scene can use 24-30s: dialogue delivery, hesitation, listener reaction, table/keys contact, and emotional aftertaste need time.
- The skill does not claim every prompt should default to 30s; it chooses a specific duration, such as 26s or 28s, only if the scene needs it.
- Final prompt stays under 3000 Chinese characters and uses the extra length for timing, performance, contact realism, spatial continuity, and ending breath.
- Dialogue is timed with pauses and breath. The key lines are explicit and have enough room before and after delivery.
- The man's smile is protective rather than cheerful; grief or collapse does not arrive before the line that triggers it.
- The keys, table, body distance, and eyelines stay consistent.
- Ending leaves at least 2s for silence, room tone, breath, or stillness after the final line.

Failure checks:

- keeps the old 15s maximum and splits even though one 24-30s prompt can carry the scene
- stretches a simple beat to 30s without dramatic reason
- exceeds 3000 Chinese characters without recommending a split
- packs all lines together with no pauses or listener reactions
- uses generic sadness labels instead of line-triggered performance changes
- cuts immediately after the final line

## Case 26: 30s Psychological Stage Timeline

Input:

```text
29秒超近情绪长镜头：女人面对即将离开的恋人，从追问到认命，再到想最后记住他的脸，最后含泪放手。她只说两句台词：“真的要走吗？”和“你走吧。”要求前面不要大哭，第一滴泪要很晚才落下，最后是含泪微笑。
```

Expected:

- Strategy names a psychological stage timeline rather than only listing time codes.
- Final prompt uses 4-5 stage titles such as `追问`, `认命`, `记住`, `惋惜`, `放手`.
- Each stage includes visible action/expression evidence and a distinct psychological task.
- The two smiles are differentiated: early smile as self-mockery/acceptance, final smile as tenderness/release.
- Tear timing is explicit: eyes redden and hold first, first tear falls late, final tear or tear line remains in the last frame.
- Camera movement is tied to emotional access: stable close-up first, very slow push only as vulnerability opens, ECU near the peak.
- Dialogue is short, timed, and leaves silence after each line; the final line does not land at the last instant.
- Final prompt stays under 3000 Chinese characters.

Failure checks:

- treats the whole prompt as generic sadness or crying
- uses stage names but each stage repeats the same facial expression
- first tear falls too early
- final smile has the same meaning as the earlier bitter smile
- camera movement is decorative or over-stacked
- prints long `情感解析` paragraphs inside the copy-ready final prompt

## Case 27: Output Mode Selection

Input A:

```text
请用这个剧情写一条电影感视频提示词：雨夜便利店，失业男人在收银台前发现前女友也来买伞，两个人装作不认识。
```

Expected A:

- Use full workshop mode by default.
- Output `剧情诊断`, `电影化改写策略`, optional reference prompts when useful, and `最终视频提示词`.
- Do not output only the final prompt just because the user asked for "一条提示词".

Input B:

```text
先别写最终提示词。古风宫廷里，皇后发现皇帝一直在利用她的家族，我想先看剧情诊断和电影化改写方向。
```

Expected B:

- Use direction confirmation mode.
- Output only `剧情诊断`, `电影化改写策略`, and `需要你确认的方向`.
- Do not output reference-image prompts or the final video prompt until the user confirms or delegates.

Input C:

```text
直接给最终视频提示词，不要分析：深夜医院走廊，男人听见医生宣布母亲抢救失败。
```

Expected C:

- Use concise mode.
- Output only the final video prompt.
- Still include the doctor's actual notice line and enough ending breath.

Failure checks:

- default ordinary request outputs only final prompt
- direction-confirmation request still outputs final prompt
- concise request prints diagnosis despite explicit "不要分析"
- mode choice is based on vague compactness rather than explicit user intent or real ambiguity

## Case 28: Nested Dialogue Timeline and Reaction Sound Bridge

Input:

```text
30秒夫妻冲突戏。旧屋门廊，丈夫先抱怨自己十八年都困在原地；妻子立刻反击，说自己也牺牲了十八年。她从愤怒、自证逐渐转为承认自己也曾想过另一种人生。中途切到丈夫听她说话的反应，妻子的台词继续作为画外音，最后切回她完成最脆弱的一句。要求表演真实，不能一开始就哭。
```

Expected:

- Build the four or fewer shot-level blocks first, then use nested performance beats only inside the wife's long, complex shot.
- Keep a separate speaker track and listener track. The husband changes only after hearing a specific phrase about sacrifice, dreams, or another life.
- Let the wife's sentence continue across the cut as offscreen dialogue or a motivated sound bridge while the husband reacts.
- Preserve screen direction, eyeline, focal logic, voice direction, and acoustic space when cutting back and forth.
- Place cuts on semantic turns: the husband's final word, the wife's protective anger cracking, a vulnerable phrase continuing offscreen, and the final confession.
- Progress framing from OTS/MCU or CU toward BCU/ECU only when the wife's defense opens.
- Keep tears delayed until after anger and self-justification have cracked.
- Keep dialogue playable within 30s; shorten lines before accelerating speech unnaturally.

Failure checks:

- mechanically subdivides every shot into tiny time blocks
- the listener is only described as `沉默` or reacts before the trigger phrase
- offscreen dialogue loses speaker identity, direction, or room continuity
- cuts occur at equal intervals with no semantic purpose
- starts in ECU and has no later framing escalation
- packs too much dialogue into the final second or cuts without reaction time

## Case 29: Minimum Sound and Lighting Baseline

Input:

```text
15秒深夜公寓悬疑戏：独居女孩听见门锁轻响，发现玄关地面多了一把陌生钥匙。她没有尖叫，只屏住呼吸，慢慢看向黑暗走廊。要求写实、克制、不要配乐。
```

Expected:

- Establish one motivated light baseline, such as a warm interior practical light against cooler corridor spill, with a stable source direction.
- Use 2-4 concrete sound anchors, such as lock click, refrigerator hum, bare-foot friction, breath, or a distant elevator.
- Let the key discovery change the sound field through narrowing, muffling, or isolated silence rather than adding generic suspense music.
- Mention shot-local light changes only when the door gap, hallway spill, phone screen, or character movement changes what is illuminated.
- Keep skin tone, eye catchlight, shadow direction, room tone, and acoustic space continuous across cuts.
- Use a compact `整体声音与光影` block or place the same information concisely in the opening summary when the prompt is short.
- Leave an audible and visual ending residue: held breath, corridor hum, key reflection, or distant elevator sound.

Failure checks:

- only says `电影感光影` or `沉浸式音效`
- gives no believable light source or sound bed
- adds dramatic BGM despite the request
- changes light direction between shots without an on-screen cause
- repeats a full lighting breakdown in every shot
- ends at the discovery with no sound tail or visual afterimage
